# AdA Project: Team go Big or go Home

# Abstract

Nowadays, there exists a myriad of products, examples of an ever-growing consumption regime. What's more, the convenience of accessing such items is only a few clicks away for most of us. We ground our reasoning on the consumer's point of view in todays world. Our starting point is the Open food facts dataset, from which we extract data on different food products. Do the values that people hold dear stand up to the comparison with the food they actually buy ? Are  the most sought after foods really the ones that should top such a ranking ? Are those products the ones that impact the most consumer health and are they the most environmental-friendly ? We will try to answer these questions by coming up with ranking containing top products regarding : consumer diet, travel from production site, carbon footprint, nutritional index, etc. These rankings will then be compared to the products bought online by consumers with the instacart dataset, most noticably the populartiy of particular items. We will then be able to create personnalized recommendations for the consumers, that will show good shopping practices and the best-in-category products. 

# Research questions

- What are the worst/best ranking products according to carbon footprint ? 
- What are the worst/best ranking products according to nutritional index ?
- Combination of these criteria, correlation between them ?
- Possible to identify specific diets ?
- How do these rankings fare against the products the users buy ?
- Can we create recommendations for users based on that data ?
- New carbon footprint index based on how popular the product is

# Dataset

- Open food facts database
- Instacart in a second part

# A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 2

- Data cleaning
- Data sorting
- Aggregation and statistics 
- Reasoning explanation and notebook commenting/redacting

# Questions for TAa
Do you have any recommendations for linking the two datasets ?
What are the possible biases in our methodology ?
