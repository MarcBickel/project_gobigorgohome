# AdA Project: Team go Big or go Home

# Title

# Abstract

Nowadays, there exists a myriad of products, examples of an ever-growing consumption regime. Furthermore, the convenience of accessing such items is only a few clicks away for most of us. In this project, we will ground our reasoning on the consumer's point of view in todays world. Our starting point will be the Open food facts dataset, from which we will extract data on several different food products. Do the values that people hold dear stand up to the comparison with the food they actually buy ? Is the most sought after type of food really the one that should top such a ranking ? Are those products the ones that impact the most consumer health and are they the most environmentally-friendly ? We will try to answer these questions by coming up with a ranking containing top products regarding : consumer diet, travel from production site, carbon footprint, nutritional index, etc. These rankings will then be compared to the products bought online by consumers with the Instacart dataset, most noticeably with the popularity of particular items. We will then be able to create personalized recommendations for the consumers. They will highlight good shopping practices and the best-in-category products. 

# Research questions

- What are the worst/best ranking products according to carbon footprint ? 
- What are the worst/best ranking products according to nutritional index ?
- Combination of these criteria, correlation between them ?
- Possible to identify specific diets ?
- How do these rankings compare to the products the users buy ?
- Can we create recommendations for users based on that data ?
- New carbon footprint index based on how popular the product is

# Dataset

- Open food facts database : We will use it to make statistics on different informations given about the food products (amongst others the nutritional index and the carbon footprint). Afterwards, we will combine different criteria in order to come up with food rankings giving for example the healthiest food for selected diets or ecological values. 
- Instacart : In a second time, we will use the instacart database to find out which types of food are bought the most by the customers. We will then use this information to find out how well the most sought after products do in the rankings we established before. 

# A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 2

- Import and clean the data
- Sort the data and extract the products we will work with
- Do aggregation and statistics 
- Explain our reasoning, comment and write the notebook

# Questions for TAa
-Do you have any recommendations on how to link the two datasets ?
-What are the possible biases in our methodology ?
