# Where do your purchases rank in our analysis ?

## Abstract
"Nowadays, there exists a myriad of products, examples of an ever-growing consumption regime. Furthermore, the convenience of accessing such items is only a few clicks away for most of us. In this project, we will ground our reasoning on the consumer's point of view in todays world. Our starting point will be the Open food facts dataset, from which we will extract data on several different food products. Do the values that people hold dear stand up to the comparison with the food they actually buy ? Is the most sought after type of food really the one that should top such a ranking ? Are those products the ones that impact the most consumer health and are they the most environmentally-friendly ? We will try to answer these questions by coming up with a ranking containing top products regarding : consumer diet, travel from production site, carbon footprint, nutritional index, etc. These rankings will then be compared to the products bought online by consumers with the Instacart dataset, most noticeably with the popularity of particular items. We will then be able to create personalized recommendations for the consumers. They will highlight good shopping practices and the best-in-category products."

### Research questions

- What are the worst/best ranking products according to nutritional index ?
- Possible to identify specific diets ?
- How do these rankings compare to the products the users buy ?
- Can we create recommendations for users based on that data ?
